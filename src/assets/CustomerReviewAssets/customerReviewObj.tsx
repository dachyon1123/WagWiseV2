This training has been life changing! He worked with my pup and more importantly worked with me on the best ways to communicate with my dog and have that trust. He cleaned up some jumping tendencies, heel, etc. but now we have full confidence in being off leash so we can enjoy parks & hikes to the fullest!",

Highly recommend this service as Bradley is extremely proficient in training as well as keeping a positive, professional environment. 5/5 stars. Looking forward to continuing Archie’s progression through Bradley’s training services!",

        reviewText: "I have 2 massive chocolate labs that basically walk me. I used to have to divide my time in the morning by taking a walk myself then coming home and playing with my dogs because I couldn’t walk them. I had ONE session with Bradley and now I am actually able to walk them! Bradley was able to implement different training exercises and teach me how to properly communicate with them resulting with my dogs understanding what I am asking of them. I am super excited to continue working with my dogs and actually be able to take family walks!",
